//as part of process management design of Unix/Linux, 
//waitpid() is typically used, in the parent processi's
//context of execution 
//to clean-up terminated/zombie children processes  
//
//waitpid() does not terminate children processes, 
//but cleans up 
//terminated, zombie,  children processes - if a child processi+1 is 
//not, in terminated/zombie state, waitpid() will not 
//do anything to this childprocess - if there is a terminated
//child processi+1, waitpid()  will delete 
//pdi+1 of the child processi+1, 
//after collecting termination status code of pdi+1 -  
//first parameter of waitpid() can be set to -1, if we allow waitpid()
//to clean-up any terminated child processi+1 of this
//parent processi,not a 
//specific child processi+1 of this processi - we will be using
//this value, for param1
//
//===========================================================
//first parameter can be a +ve value(pidi+1 of a specific 
//child processi+1, if we wish to clean-up
//a specific terminated(zombie) child processi+1) - we will
//not be using this value, for param1
//===========================================================
// 
//in our cases, we will be using -1, for cleaning-up
//any child processi+1 - 
//using -1 is a common case - if we pass -1, it means, 
//that waitpid() will clean-up any terminated child
//processi+1 of this parent processi 
//
//second parameter is used to collect the termination 
//status code of a zombie child processi+1,during 
//clean-up  - when waitpid()
//cleans-up a terminated child processi+1,it will collect 
//the termination status code from the pdi+1 and fill 
//the second parameter, status field - in this context, p2 is an 
//address/pointer of an user-space variable to a system call API - this 
//pointer will be used by the system call service 
//routine, to copy termination status code of pdi+1 into
///an user-space variable...
//
//   
//last parameter is flags, which we do not use normally, so
//set to 0 - ignore the last parameter, for the time-being -
//if we set this flag to 0, waitpid() will behave normally -
//this is what we want - this is also the normal usage, so
//flags are set to 0 
// 
//
//based on the current set of parameters, let us understand the 
//behaviour of waitpid(), in this parent process, when
//it is invoked ??
//
//
//--->in this parent process, following is a scenario: 
//
//if waitpid() is invoked, in this parent processi 
//and a terminated/zombie 
//child processi+1 
//is waiting for clean-up, waitpid() system call will collect the 
//the termination status code of pdi+1 and store it, in p2's location and 
//complete the 
//clean-up of the zombie child processi+1/pdi+1 - delete pdi+1 of the 
//terminated child processi+1 - foot-print of a terminated
//child processi+1 is deleted, in the system - once clean-up processing 
//is complete, waitpid() will return  
//the pidi+1 of 
//the just cleaned-up processi+1/pdi+1 - there is a return value 
//
//--->in this parent processi, following is another scenario: 
//
//if waitpid(-1, &status, 0) is invoked and 
//currently, there are no 
//terminated/zombie children processes of this 
//parent processi , waitpid() will block
//the parent processi, until any one child processi+1 of
//this parent processi is 
//terminated and enters zombie state - 
//waitpid(-1, &status, 0) is a blocking system call API,for
//certain conditions - whenever a child processi+1 is 
//terminated, it will enter the zombie state - 
//if the waiting condition is satisfied, 
//the parent processi+1 is  unblocked and  scheduled/
//dispatched/executed - the above unblocking is done, 
//in the background - now, parent processi will be scheduled/
//dispatched/executed, and waitpid() will resume and 
//complete its job - clean-up 
//will complete and waitpid() will return a +ve value
//(pid of zombie pdi+1) - in addition, termination status code
//will be copied into param2's location....
//waitpid() is a blocking system call, in this context -  

    ret = waitpid(-1,&status,0); //better, for this scenario
    //ret = waitpid(pid_ary[i],&status,0); //not appropriate
                                           //for this 
                                           //scenario
            
    if(ret>0){
//if waitpid() successfully cleans-up a terminated
//child processi+1, 
//it will collect and copy the status code,in 
//param2's location and also return
//a +ve value of the pidi+1 of the 
//cleaned-up child processi+1, in ret

//we cannot use termination status code stored, in

//using appropriate OS macros --  
//if  WIFEXITED(status) returns TRUE, the child processi+1
//terminated normally and exit(0) or exit(n) was invoked, 
//in the code of child processi+1 --
//if the WIFEXITED(status) returns FALSE, the child processi+1 was
//terminated abnormally/forcibly and an Unix/Linux signal was involved, 
//implicitly or explicitly -- 
//WIFEXITED(status) uses "termination status code stored", 
//in status to check, for normal or abnormal termination
//of the cleaned-up zombie child process/pd  - it will not 
//check the exit status code

                          //child process

//WEXITSTATUS(status) will provide 0, if the childi+1's
//active applicationi 
//completed successfully and invoked exit(0) ---
//in this context, applicationi completes successfully and 
//the processi+1 terminates normally
//WEXITSTATUS(status) will extract the  "exit status code"
//stored, in the status variable - if this value is 0, 
//it means, the zombie childi+1 terminated normally, as well
//as the corresponding active applicationi completed 
//successfully - completed its job
//
//however, if the WEXITSTATUS(status) return non-zero 
//value(the stored exit status code, in status),
//the zombie child processi+1 terminated normally, but
//the active applicationi did not complete its job, 
//successfully - there was some error, in the 
//code execution 
//
//   
       if(WEXITSTATUS(status) == 0){ //normal and successfull

//if WIFEXITED(status) returns FALSE, the child processi+1

    }
   }//ret>0
